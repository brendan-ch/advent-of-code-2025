# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code 2025 puzzles. Each directory is its own project which can be compiled with g++.

To run, compile each day's solution using g++. Each day contains both Part 1 and 2 (hopefully).

```
cd [directory name]
g++ *.cpp
```

You may also change the `input.txt` file within the directory to your puzzle input; the one in GitHub is my generated puzzle input.
